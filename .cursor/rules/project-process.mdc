description: Planning, tracking, and versioning conventions for PocketKerala
alwaysApply: true

## Planning and tracking

- All **product planning, roadmaps, and task tracking** for PocketKerala live in **Linear**, not in this repo.
- Use **Linear projects, cycles, and issues** as the single source of truth for what to work on and current status.
- Keep GitHub issues minimal and code-focused (if used at all); they should link back to the corresponding Linear item when relevant.

## GitHub usage

- This GitHub repository is the **canonical source of code** for PocketKerala.
- Avoid duplicating planning documents here, except for high‑level README docs or architecture notes.

## Version control conventions

- Use **semantic-style versioning** for releases when tagging (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
  - Bump **PATCH** for backwards-compatible bug fixes.
  - Bump **MINOR** for backwards-compatible feature additions or UX improvements.
  - Bump **MAJOR** for breaking changes or significant rewrites.
- Keep the `main` branch in a **deployable state**; do work in feature branches and merge via pull requests with clear, descriptive titles.
